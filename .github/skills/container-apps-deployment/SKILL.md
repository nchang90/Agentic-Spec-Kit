# Container Apps Deployment Patterns

Supplements the official `azure-prepare` plugin skill with additional gotchas for Container Apps deployments — zone redundancy, azure.yaml, and SPA frontend patterns.

> **📖 ACR authentication:** Use a deterministic two-phase pattern with separate deployment modules. The bootstrap module provisions each Container App with a public placeholder image and system-assigned identity but no `configuration.registries` entry. Grant that principal `AcrPull`, then make a later module depend on the role assignment and update the same app with the ACR login server and `identity: 'system'` before deploying private images. A single module that declares both a new system identity and registry is not two-phase and can fail with an ACR token-exchange 401. Some azd versions call `az containerapp registry set` automatically and some do not. Never assume that implicit step occurred; verify the registry configuration before the first private-image deployment.

## Region-Specific Gotchas

### Container Apps Environment `zoneRedundant`

The AVM module `br/public:avm/res/app/managed-environment` may default `zoneRedundant` to true. Several regions (including `westus`) don't support it.

```bicep
module cae 'br/public:avm/res/app/managed-environment:0.8.1' = {
  params: {
    // ...
    zoneRedundant: false  // Required for westus and other regions without zone support
  }
}
```

**Without this:** `azd up` fails with "Zone redundancy is not currently supported in this region".

## azure.yaml Configuration

### Docker services require `language` field

azd requires either `language` or `image` on each service, even when `docker.path` is specified:

```yaml
services:
  api:
    host: containerapp
    language: ts                  # REQUIRED — azd won't infer from Dockerfile
    docker:
      path: api/Dockerfile
      context: api
      remoteBuild: true
```

Declare each service whose image azd owns this way. AIMarket declares only `api`; Bicep creates its web Container App and the project postdeploy hook owns the storefront ACR build and update. **Without `language`:** `azd up` fails with "must specify language or image". **Without `remoteBuild: true`:** `azd` can require a local Docker daemon.

### Cross-platform hooks

This repository requires `azd` 1.28.0 or later and Node.js LTS or later. Use JavaScript or TypeScript hooks referenced directly from `azure.yaml`; `azd` detects the language from the extension. Do not generate Bash-only `.sh` or PowerShell-only `.ps1` lifecycle hooks.

```yaml
hooks:
  postprovision:
    run: infra/hooks/postprovision.js
  postdeploy:
    run: infra/hooks/postdeploy.js
```

Use `postprovision` for steps that need infrastructure outputs, such as setting `WEBHOOK_URL`. Use `postdeploy` for steps that need deployed services, such as rebuilding a frontend with its API URL. Hook code must invoke `az` and `azd` through argument arrays, never interpolated shell command strings. On Mac and Linux, call the CLI executable directly. On Windows, `.cmd` shims cannot be launched with `execFileSync()` or `spawnSync()` alone. Invoke a static, non-interpolated `powershell.exe` runner and pass the command plus arguments as a JSON environment payload, then use PowerShell's call operator with array splatting. This supports both the Azure CLI shim and the `azd.exe` installation without exposing arguments to shell parsing. Build deployment images in Azure Container Registry so the host does not need Docker or Buildx.

## SPA Frontend Deployment (React/Vite)

### The VITE_API_URL Problem

When deploying a React/Vite frontend and API as **separate Container Apps**, the frontend needs the API's URL baked in at build time. But the API URL isn't known until after provisioning.

**Symptoms:**
- Frontend shows `Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`
- The React app calls `/api/products` on the web container (nginx), which returns `index.html`

**Root Cause:** `VITE_API_URL` defaults to `/api` (the Vite dev proxy). In production, nginx has no `/api` route — it serves the SPA for all paths.

### Solution: Cross-platform post-deploy hook

**Do not leave this as a manual learner step on first success.** Generate `infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` and reference it directly from `azure.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  postdeploy:
    run: infra/hooks/postdeploy.js
```

The JavaScript hook must:

1. Resolve the application root from CommonJS `__dirname` rather than assuming the current working directory.
2. Read `API_URL`, `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`, and `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` with `azd env get-value`.
3. Find the web Container App by its `azd-service-name=web` tag.
4. Run `az acr build` with `--platform linux/amd64`, a unique image tag, and `--build-arg VITE_API_URL=<API_URL>/api`.
5. Update the web Container App to use the cloud-built image.
6. Wait until the expected revision is healthy and provisioned, then verify the storefront can load products. When `minReplicas` is `0`, accept both `Running` and `ScaledToZero`; requiring only `Running` causes a false timeout before the verification request can activate the revision.

Call external tools with `execFileSync()` or `spawnSync()` and argument arrays. Do not concatenate a shell command, use `chmod`, or depend on Bash, `cut`, `grep`, or `date`. The static Windows PowerShell launcher described above is the only platform-specific exception; all CLI arguments must travel in the JSON environment payload. Windows PowerShell cannot losslessly pass a literal double quote inside a native argument, so reject it for every Windows target. For `.cmd`/`.bat`, also reject `&`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `^`, `%`, `!`, `(`, `)`, and CR/LF. Rewrite unsafe arguments or use attached files; native `.exe` targets preserve the remaining metacharacters. Use JavaScript for path handling, timestamps, retries, and JSON parsing.

For a storefront-only rebuild, run `node infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` explicitly and verify production product loading. In the AIMarket pattern the web Container App is not an azd service, so `azd deploy web` is not a valid command.

**After the first green deploy**, explain why the hook exists. Don't make the learner discover a blank product grid first.

### Frontend Dockerfile Requirements

```dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
ARG VITE_API_URL
ENV VITE_API_URL=$VITE_API_URL
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
```

**Keys:** `ARG` + `ENV` must appear **before** `RUN npm run build` so Vite picks up the URL. The postdeploy hook sends this Dockerfile to an ACR `linux/amd64` cloud build.

### nginx.conf — SPA Only

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

**Do NOT add an `/api/` proxy block.** The frontend calls the API directly via `VITE_API_URL`. Adding a proxy to an internal hostname will fail because Container Apps don't resolve each other by name without VNet.

### Frontend API Client Pattern

```typescript
const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || '/api';

export async function getProducts() {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/products`);
  return res.json();
}
```

In dev: `VITE_API_URL` is unset → falls back to `/api` → Vite proxy handles it.
In prod: `VITE_API_URL` is `https://ca-api-xxx.azurecontainerapps.io/api` → calls API directly.

## .dockerignore Requirements

Every build context sent to ACR needs a `.dockerignore` that excludes dependency directories (`node_modules/`), build output, local database files, `.env` files, and Git metadata (`.git/`). Keep the files the in-container build itself needs — for the default Node.js stack, do not exclude `tsconfig.json` or `package*.json`, or the container's TypeScript build fails. An unfiltered context can also overwhelm the ACR build upload.

## ARM64 Host Cross-Compilation

Azure Container Apps runs Linux AMD64. This applies to Apple Silicon, Windows ARM64, and Linux ARM64 hosts.

Require ACR cloud builds targeting `linux/amd64`. Do not require Docker, Buildx, AMD64 emulation, or privileged QEMU/binfmt handlers on the host.

Without an AMD64 target, the container can crash with `exec format error`. ACR builds remove that host-architecture dependency.

## Bicep `uniqueString()` Length Contracts

Azure's `uniqueString()` always returns 13 characters. When passing that value into a module, declare the module parameter with both `@minLength(13)` and `@maxLength(13)`. Otherwise Bicep can emit false `BCP334` warnings when the parameter is used in constrained resource names.

## Bicep Output Naming Convention

Outputs must use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for azd to pick them up:

```bicep
output API_URL string = 'https://${apiApp.outputs.fqdn}'
output WEB_URL string = 'https://${webApp.outputs.fqdn}'
output AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT string = acr.outputs.loginServer
output RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME string = rg.name
```

Wrong naming → `azd env get-value` returns "key not found".
